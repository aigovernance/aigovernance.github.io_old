# Topics

We are excited to announce the ``AI governance'' workshop at the IJCAI 2024, a critical event addressing the principles, frameworks, and best practices necessary to navigate the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of AI.

The rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) bring unprecedented opportunities and challenges. As organizations and governments increasingly integrate AI technologies into various aspects of society, the need for effective AI governance becomes paramount. This workshop aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AI governance principles, frameworks, and best practices to empower participants in navigating the ethical, legal, and societal dimensions of AI.

In addition to insightful technical discussions, we also plan to hold introductory talks to educate a broader community about the importance and urgency of AI governance. These talks will serve as a foundational introduction to the subject matter and its implications for society at large.

AI governance is a critical field with two distinct communities: policymakers crafting regulations and researchers/developers working on the technologies. The workshop aims to bring these communities together to foster collaboration and enhance understanding. The workshop aims to educate a broader community about the intricacies of AI governance. Through informative sessions and discussions, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges posed by AI technologies and the need for effective governance. We invite submissions of papers, posters, and demonstrations on any topic related to AI Governance, including but not limited to:

- **Understanding AI Governance**: Define the core principles of AI governance. Explore existing regulations and ethical frameworks
- **Role of LLMs in AI Governance**: Highlight the capabilities of LLMs in analyzing and generating human-readable content. Discuss how LLMs can contribute to drafting policies and guidelines.
- **Addressing Bias and Fairness**: Examine the challenges of bias in AI systems. Showcase how LLMs can assist in identifying and mitigating bias.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Explore the importance of transparency in AI decision-making. Discuss how LLMs can aid in creating understandable and accountable AI systems.
- **Policy Interpretation and Compliance**: Illustrate how LLMs can assist policymakers in understanding complex technical concepts. Discuss the role of LLMs in monitoring and auditing AI systems for compliance with governance standards.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Emphasize the need for human oversight in AI governance. Discuss the collaborative approach between humans and LLMs.
- AI alignment methods
- Prompt engineering
- Fine tuning
- Explainable AI
- Responsible AI practices

We welcome submissions from researchers working on related topics such as neural program synthesis, program induction, and concept learning.

# Submission Instructions

Submissions should be in the form of a 7-page papers (+2-page references) for proceeding articles or a 2-page abstract for posters/demonstrations, and should be formatted according to the conferenceâ€™s guidelines (https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in a workshop proceeding, unless opted out by the authors.

The review will be double-blind, so please keep your submission(s) anonymous. The accepted papers have the option to be archival (i.e. included in the proceeding) or non-archival (i.e. only hosted in the website). The archival papers should be sufficiently original and not published in another venue or journal. The non-archival papers can be relevant work presented or published in another venue or journal.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters. The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation. There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees.

We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you at the workshop. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the organizing committee.

The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ijcai.org/IJCAI/2024/Workshop/AIGOV)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **June 20, 2023**, and will be posted on the workshop website.

# Camera-Ready and Proceeding Instructions

To streamline the publication process, we have implemented a two-step approach for camera-ready publications.

Firstly, all accepted papers are hosted on our website via OpenReview during the conference period. To ensure inclusion in this phase, please revise your papers based on the reviewers' comments, include your author affiliations, and adhere to the IJCAI format. The deadline for uploading this version to OpenReview is **June 20, 2024**.

Secondly, we are publishing the accepted and invited papers in a book in collaboration with Springer Nature as the post-conference proceedings. Please follow the instructions as in the email sent to you.

The deadline for the proceeding submission is **Oct 25, 2024**.
